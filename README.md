# Titanic Survival Prediction model

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.


## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic, one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze the available data and build a predictive model that can determine the fate of individual passengers.

The repository provides a step-by-step guide and code implementation for the prediction process. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Additionally, it offers insights into the factors that influenced survival rates among Titanic passengers.

## Data

The Titanic dataset used in this project can be found in csv file included. It contains information about individual passengers, including their survival status, age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and other relevant attributes.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn



## Results

The results of the Titanic survival prediction model is 74% accurate. This includes visualizations, evaluation metrics, and any relevant analysis.
